fujitsu ltd. said it wants to withdraw its controversial one - yen bid to design a waterworks computer system for the city of hiroshima .
hiroshima last week held an auction to pick the contractor , expecting to pay about 11 million yen for the project .
eight companies submitted bids , but fujitsu won the contract by essentially saying it would do the job for free .
news of the bid drew sharp criticism from other computer companies and industry observers .
fujitsu itself , which said the bid hadn ' t been approved by its headquarters , was clearly embarrassed .
the bid wasn ' t '' socially acceptable , '' a company spokeswoman said .
hiroshima officials said they still consider the contract in effect and had no immediate plans to cancel it .
they said they wanted to wait for the outcome of any government investigation before deciding what to do .

wary investors have been running for the stock market 's equivalent of bomb shelters , buying shares of gold - mining and utility companies .
those two groups have recently been leading the list of stocks setting new highs .
on monday , when a mere seven common stocks managed new highs , six were utilities or golds .
at first glance , gold and utilities seem strange bedfellows .
after all , gold prices usually soar when inflation is high .
but the two groups have something very important in common : they are both havens for scared money , stocks for people who hate stocks .
if the stock market and the economy catch their breath and show that they 're on firmer footing , these stocks might well fall back .
indeed , that happened to some extent yesterday , as industrial stocks rebounded , partly on news of takeovers in the paper industry .
still , a lot of investors clearly have revived their interest in gold and utility shares . ''
the primary overriding thing is that people are frightened , '' says martin sass , a new york money manager . ''
the aftershocks of oct. 13 -lrb- when the dow jones industrial average dropped 190 points -rrb- are still reverberating . ''
certainly , the oct. 13 sell - off didn ' t settle any stomachs .
beyond that , money managers and analysts see other problems .
inventories are creeping up ; car inventories are already high , and big auto makers are idling plants .
takeover fever has cooled , removing a major horse from the market 's cart .
britain 's unsettled political scene also worries some investors . ''
with this sort of sentiment common , it 's natural for investors to seek out '' defensive '' investments .
utilities are a classic example : even in recessions , people continue to use electric power , water and gas at a fairly steady rate .
such defensive issues as food , tobacco , and drug stocks have been in favor for some time .
but many of these stocks have now become expensive .
mr. wachtel points to coca - cola co. and pepsico inc. as examples : they 're selling for 18 to 22 times estimated 1990 per - share earnings .
gold stocks aren ' t cheap on this basis , either , with many selling for 20 times earnings or more .
even utility stocks aren ' t all that inexpensive , at an average of 14 times earnings .
but the two groups represent a further step in defensiveness .
if gold stocks and utilities continue to lead , it may signal that the market is in for rough times .
that 's just what joseph granville expects . ''
we are going to explode lower , '' says the flamboyant market seer , who had a huge following a few years back . ''
anyone telling you to buy stocks in this market is technically irresponsible .
you don ' t want to own anything long except gold stocks . ''
one reason for his gloom is a weekly tally he keeps of stocks within a point of hitting new highs or lows .
last friday , 96 stocks on the big board hit new 12 - month lows .
but by mr. granville 's count , 493 issues were within one point of such lows .
robert stovall , a veteran new york money manager and president of stovall / twenty - first securities , has money in both gold and utility issues . ''
i think we could very well have -lcb- an economic -rcb- slowdown , beginning very soon if not already , '' he says .
mr. stovall doesn ' t expect an actual recession .
but he does expect '' a muffler dragger '' of an economy , with '' very slow growth , maybe one quarter of no growth at all . ''
in such a climate , utility stocks look good to him .
he favors fpl group inc. , florida progress corp. , teco energy inc. , wisconsin energy corp. , and dominion resources inc. .
the appeal of gold issues , mr. stovall says , is that '' they 're a counter group .
you go into them because they move counter to the general market . ''
he adds that gold stocks had been down so long they were '' ready for a bounce . ''
his favorites are american barrick resources corp. , echo bay mines ltd. and coeur d ` alene mines corp. .
nevertheless , mr. stovall emphasizes that '' you don ' t buy -lcb- gold stocks -rcb- based on powerful fundamentals . ''
in addition to having high price - earnings ratios , most pay puny dividends , if any . ''
the earning power -lcb- of gold mining companies -rcb- is restricted unless the gold price hops up over $ 425 an ounce , '' he says .
abby cohen , an investment strategist for drexel burnham lambert , also thinks it makes sense to have some money in both utilities and gold . ''
my outlook is for a decline of about 10 % in corporate profits '' in 1990 , she says .
but '' a bunch of utilities '' should post profit increases .
among utilities , drexel currently favors entergy corp. and general public utilities corp. .
as for gold , she notes that it usually rises when the dollar is weak , as it has been lately .
among gold stocks , drexel likes battle mountain gold co. , newmont gold co. and freeport - mcmoran gold co. .

to suggest that a 10 % drop in ozone by the middle of the next century would be negligible is irresponsible and shortsighted .
consider the fact that a mere 2 % drop in ozone would increase birth defects and mutations by allowing solar radiation to alter the dna structure .
even a small reduction is unacceptable and to suggest otherwise is penny - wise and pound - foolish .
the reason environmentalists '' don ' t mind seeing new crises arise '' is because there are new crises .
crises larger and more dangerous to the quality of life than they were 10 years ago .
this is a fact and not the product of some environmental doomsayer or a group 's ploy to create a market .
an important part of my effort has been to understand the science so i can explain it to corporate colleagues facing major changes in product design .
our concern for the ozone layer , of course , grows out of the potential for increasing uv - b radiation , which could damage flora and fauna .
the last of the measurements reported was in 1985 , but recent conversations with mr. scotto indicated that he knew of no recent changes in the trend .
to me , this calls into question the validity of the rowland - molina theory and hence the whole chlorofluorocarbons replacement effort .
this , in turn , threatens the massive vested interests of which you have written .
but this is almost an underground activity .
to my knowledge , no government entities , including the epa , are pursuing uv - b measurements .
the topic never comes up in ozonedepletion '' establishment '' meetings , of which i have attended many .
it seems to me that such measurements are a vital part of any intellectually honest evaluation of the threat posed by cfcs .
while recognizing that professional environmentalists may feel threatened , i intend to urge that uv - b be monitored whenever i can .

although , like all scientific theories , it had its initial opponents , few experts question the connection now .
mr. melloan quotes peter teagan and invokes the name of arthur d. little inc. to support his statement .
however , unlike messrs. graedel and crutzen , who are both pioneers in the study of atmospheric chemistry , mr. teagan has no special expertise in the area .
he is a mechanical engineer , not an atmospheric chemist .

miniscribe also hasn ' t filed any financial statements for 1989 .
mr. rifenburgh said such statements should be ready by the end of november .
he said he expects the company to have $ 500 million in sales for this year .
he didn ' t say what the company expected to report for year - earlier sales , which will be restated from the previously reported $ 603 million .
it 's a wait - and - see attitude , '' said dave vellante , vice president of storage research for international data corp. .
the company also faces delisting by the national association of securities dealers .
the company continues to trade in the over - the - counter market with an exception to listing requirements .
miniscribe common closed yesterday at $ 1.9375 , down 6.25 cents , and has been trading for several months at less than $ 3 a share .
the internal investigation also criticized miniscribe 's auditors , coopers _ and _ lybrand , for allegedly ignoring numerous red flags .
mr. rifenburgh said the board still hasn ' t acted on most of the internal report 's recommendations , pending restatement of the balance sheet .
he added that he expects to make a recommendation within a few weeks on whether miniscribe should file its own lawsuits against former company officers and directors .
similarly , visual images will be more vivid , sensational and , sometimes , gruesome .
bankers trust new york corp. won permission from the federal reserve board to move the company 's private placement department to its fledgling securities subsidiary .
the fed 's action increases the volume of publicly registered securities that banks ` securities affiliates will be able to underwrite .
several other banks have similar applications pending .
securities firms have challenged those fed approvals , saying they violate federal laws separating the banking and securities businesses .
for some banks that 10 % ceiling created problems .
but , by allowing bt securities inc. to handle private placements , the fed boosted the volume of new types of underwriting that the unit can do .
last year , bankers trust said it placed $ 10 billion of corporate debt and equities privately .

she retains her duties of human - resources director .
as many as 50 of his employees at specialized bicycle components inc. ride with him .
when they return to their desks at 1 p. m. , they have pedaled 20 miles .
such fervor for cycling helped mr. sinyard build a creative company at the forefront of its industry .
in the past five years , the company 's sales have grown to $ 80 million from $ 26 million .
-lrb- accessories , largely for mountain - bike users , account for much of the rest of sales . -rrb-
but today , the company needs its entrepreneurial spirit more than ever .
thus , mr. sinyard 's company must innovate more than ever to stay ahead of them , by developing new products specifically for mountain biking .
at the same time , though , it must become more structured to better manage its growth .
accomplishing both will be a balancing act as challenging as riding a unicycle .
it is a problem common to small companies that have grown fast - - especially when their success attracts big - time competitors . ''
what i hope to bring to this is another word : process .
that 's my challenge .
it 's mike 's challenge as well . ''
we had a lot of problems , '' mr. sinyard says .
adds mr. eidsmo , '' what felt good that day was done that day . ''
but it 's risky , '' he says of specialized 's attempt to adopt a corporate structure . ''
you don ' t want to lose the magic '' of the company 's creative drive .
hoping to stay ahead of the pack , the company is emphasizing innovation .
by replacing the frame 's steel lugs with titanium ones , mr. sinyard 's company plans to make its next generation of frames even lighter .
at the trade show , specialized also unveiled a revolutionary three - spoked bike wheel developed jointly by specialized and du pont co. .
it currently costs $ 750 , though mr. sinyard thinks the price can be reduced within three years to between $ 200 and $ 250 .
he was able to slash the price of the company 's least expensive mountain bike to $ 279 from $ 750 in 1981 .
but demands on the company 's creativity are certain to grow .
competition is intensifying as larger companies invade a mountain - bike market mr. sinyard 's company once had virtually all to itself .
u.s. cycling federation official philip milburn says mountain biking is '' growing at such a monstrous rate that a lot of companies are getting into this . ''
one especially coveted specialized market the new players are targeting is mountain - bike accessories , which mr. eidsmo calls '' the future of our business . ''
to get a piece of the business , nike inc. , beaverton , ore. , introduced a line of mountain - bike shoes .
about a month ago , michelin tire corp. , greenville , s.c. , began selling mountain - bike tires , for years a specialized stronghold .
competition in the sale of complete bikes is heating up too .
the segment now makes up roughly two - thirds of his company 's total sales .
at giant bicycle inc. , rancho dominguez , calif. , sales have tripled since the company entered the u.s. mountain - bike business in 1987 .
schwinn bicycle co. , chicago , established joint ventures with bike companies in mainland china and hungary to sell bikes .
in the past year , derby international corp. , luxembourg , has acquired such major brands as peugeot , raleigh and nishiki .
in response to the internationalization of the business , mr. sinyard 's company is replacing independent distributors overseas with wholly owned subsidiaries .
the move will cut out the cost of a middleman and give specialized more control over marketing and sales .
but as bill austin , giant 's president , puts it , '' with some of the bigger players consolidating their strength , the game has changed . ''

we 'll raise it through bank loans .
we 'll raise it through -lcb- new -rcb- equity .
and we 'll raise it through existing shareholders '' as well as through junk bonds , said anthony simonds - gooding , the private consortium 's chief executive .
he said he believes the bank loan , to be arranged by february , will supply about half of the financing .
british satellite , which already has raised # 423.5 million from 10 backers , initially expected to seek an additional # 400 million .
but mr. simonds - gooding said he isn ' t talking to any studios about investing .
besides bond corp. , british satellite 's other backers include pearson plc , reed international plc and granada group plc. .
the consortium faced a setback in may when technical problems forced it to postpone the september launch until next spring .
continued uncertainty about the timing of the consortium 's debut could make it hard to find a # 450 million cash injection .
the bankers also insist that the loans depend on the consortium raising more money from new and existing backers .

courtaulds plc announced plans to spin off its textiles operations to existing shareholders in a restructuring to boost shareholder value .
the establishment of the separate company , to be called courtaulds textiles , could be effective as early as next year 's first quarter .
investors welcomed the move .
courtaulds ` shares rose 15 pence to 362 pence , valuing the entire company at about # 1.44 billion .
courtaulds ` spinoff reflects pressure on british industry to boost share prices beyond the reach of corporate raiders .
the divested courtaulds textile operations had operating profit of # 50 million on # 980 million in revenue in the year ended march 31 .
in addition , courtaulds said the moves are logical because they will allow both the chemicals and textile businesses to focus more closely on core activities .
courtaulds has been under pressure to enhance shareholder value since takeover speculators - - including australian financier kerry packer - - surfaced holding small stakes last year .
though mr. packer has since sold his stake , courtaulds is moving to keep its institutional shareholders happy .
the sharper definition and the autonomy which each will thereby gain will benefit shareholders , customers and employees . ''
courtaulds chairman and chief executive sir christopher hogg will remain in both posts at the surviving chemical company after the spinoff .

nec corp. said it plans to more than double its british subsidiary 's capacity for the production of semiconductor wafers .
officials said they weren ' t sure how the money will be distributed among overseas units , but added that nec semiconductors u.k. ltd. will receive priority .
september was the 10 th consecutive month in which steel exports failed to reach the year - earlier level .
a federation official attributed the decline to brisk demand from domestic industries backed by continuing economic expansion in japan .
they are just too busy to meet domestic demand and have little room for overseas shipments , '' the official said .
director steve kloves took a big gamble on michelle pfeiffer 's voice .
so the call went out for sally stevens .
ms. stevens is what is known in the trade as a studio singer .
her voice is audible on the incidental music for the tv series '' the wonder years , '' '' miami vice '' and '' matlock . ''
she has also worked frequently as a lyricist and as a vocal contractor , hiring and conducting choruses to sing movie title tracks . ''
most of what i do is very anonymous .
but i was not brave enough to say i was willing to starve to death to be a recording artist .
ms. stevens 's involvement with '' baker boys '' was the result of a long affiliation with the movie 's composer , dave grusin . ''
i had written lyrics with him and had sung for him in various films and contracted voices for him , '' she said . ''
he knew my work and he called .
it was really funny .
when you approach a singer and tell her you don ' t want her to sing you always run the risk of offending .
at that point nobody , including ms. pfeiffer herself , was certain it would be possible .
i had not done any coaching before , '' she said . ''
i have produced vocal performances in the studio for professional singers .
but i had never taken anyone from scratch before .
i had to go a lot by instinct .
accordingly , ms. pfeiffer incorporated anger into the development of her character .
i suggested michelle listen to ella , '' said ms. stevens . ''
from the way she sang in those early sessions , it seemed clear that michelle had been listening not to ella but to bob dylan . ''
there was a pronunciation and approach that seemed dylan - influenced , '' recalled ms. stevens .
vowels were swallowed , word endings were given short or no shrift . ''
when we worked it almost became a joke with us that i was constantly reminding her to say the consonants as well as the vowels . ''
mr. grusin also made a demo tape with just piano to provide accompaniment when ms. pfeiffer practiced .
when we first started working it was a matter of finding a language we both understood , '' ms. stevens said . ''
i couldn ' t talk with her as i would with someone who had a lot of vocal training . ''
so what ms. stevens talked about was the importance of saying the words at the front of the mouth with the lips and the teeth .
say '' funn - eeee . ''
put the clean vowel ending on it .
and michelle , must you continue to smoke two packs of cigarettes a day ? ''
it was a process of discovery , '' said ms. stevens , who admitted she sometimes felt a bit like henry higgins . ''
what i tried to do was take the sparks of the positive stuff and fan them .
i tried not to do much ` don ' t do this , don ' t do that . ' ''
there was another layer to the coaching : helping ms. pfeiffer sing a song the way susie diamond would sing it .
it was an exercise of blending michelle 's singing with susie 's singing , '' explained ms. stevens . ''
that isn ' t really her . '' ''
seeing michelle up there , '' she added , '' was like watching myself or my daughter .
i was so nervous .
i wanted her to be so good .
i didn ' t want to feel as if i 'd let her down . ''

as the leading candidate for president of his country in next year 's election , mario vargas llosa ought to be in an enviable position .
but , after some hesitation , he is back on the stump and also still writing important novels about peru . ''
but he is swiftly drawn into a tangle of memories about a less newsworthy and more exotic part of peru : its corner of the amazon jungle .
this narrator is a foil for mr. vargas llosa , a cosmopolitan writer with one well - tailored leg in journalism .
but this narrator happens upon some photographs in a gallery , pictures taken in peruvian amazonia of the untamed and nomadic machiguenga tribe .
and they remind him of his own experiences with that unhappy scattered culture and of his friend at lima 's university of san marcos , saul zuratas .
this is what we know at the end of the opening section of '' the storyteller . ''
the next voice we hear sounds like this : '' there was no evil , there was no wind , there was no rain .
the women bore pure children .
keeping on , with or without rain , by land or by water , climbing up the mountain slopes or climbing down the ravines . ''
the speaker is never identified .
he tells his stories in his majestically simple way , in a '' language '' all his own .
there are creation myths and cosmologies and hunting stories - - a whole culture is contained within these dreamy narratives .
it is as though mr. vargas llosa had recorded a storytelling session at a machiguenga campfire .
for most of the book , there is no direct connection between its urban and its amazonian modes .
but the contrast between them becomes a living thing through the brilliant contrast of narrative styles that mr. vargas llosa creates .
but the joke turns serious when a reportage takes him to amazonia and he encounters the missionaries who know more than anyone else about the machiguengas .
the storytellers traveled among the bands , reminding them of their identity .
but why would no machiguenga the narrator meets during his reportage even admit that there were storytellers ?
the narrator eventually deduces the extraordinary answer , which is confirmed in a literally kafkaesque manner by a storyteller in the next chapter .
i am trying to give away as little as possible , but this is not really a mystery or some kind of jungle thriller .

analyses of why currencies do what they do , losing or gaining value against goods or each other , are a favorite pursuit of economists .
they also are often opaque to non - economists .
eyes glaze over when monetarists talk about base money , velocity or purchasing power parity .
britain 's inflation probably is traceable in part to mr. lawson 's failure to get the pound - deutsche mark exchange rate right .
one economic model fashioned out of this concept is predicting a u.s. recession late this year or early next year .
if u.s. monetary policy goes astray it will have repercussions well beyond those that unseated the estimable mr. lawson .
the wdb model in question is a product of an upstart economics shop called bell mueller cannon inc. -lrb- bmc -rrb- .
when goldman sachs challenged the bmc recession forecast in its economic newsletter a few weeks ago , the bmc folks were delighted .
even though critical , it was just the kind of attention they were seeking .
so they fired back at the goldman sachs objections in their own economics letter , '' the bmc report . ''
they also arranged a luncheon in new york to further explain their forecast and solicit new clients .
the bmc folks aren ' t really amateurs at intellectual dueling .
president jeffrey bell in 1978 upset longtime new jersey republican senator clifford case in a primary and made an unsuccessful run at bill bradley 's u.s. senate seat .
so even though bmc is only 18 months old , its principals have been part of the national economic debate for years .
what is the world dollar base ?
an article on these pages by mr. mueller on june 29 touched off the debate with goldman sachs .
the world dollar base , in fact , is analogous to the world stock of monetary gold under the classical gold standard , '' wrote mr. mueller .
bmc says it was able to predict the rise in inflation in the u.s. early this year from observing rapid growth in the world dollar base .
the bundesbank might be rather surprised to be told that dollar purchases and sales were their only instrument for monetary policy -rsb- '' observed goldman sachs . ''
foreign central banks buy or sell government securities to add or drain reserves from the banking system . ''
over the past 20 years or so , the dollar has followed an erratic course .
but that cherished notion may have influenced mr. lawson to peg the pound too low , causing britain to import all of europe 's inflationary pressures .
a weak currency creates bargains for foreign buyers , sometimes pushing demand beyond a nation 's productive capacity and forcing prices upward .
criticisms of the u.s. treasury for agreeing to participate in an international effort to drive down the dollar last month are based on that danger .
the u.s. , because of the dollar 's world role , also has exported inflation at times .
u.s. monetary policies ultimately will determine whether other nations are willing to accept american economic hegemony .
their challenges to that hegemony are probably a good thing .
the u.s. congress and administration need frequent reminders of that responsibility .
the best test of how well that responsibility is being exercised can be found simply in how much the dollar holds its value relative to goods and services .
but in a practical world , currency relationships can ' t be ignored either .
whatever else the bmc model accomplishes , it furthers the discussion of how to achieve world monetary order .
given the damaging effects of monetary disorders of the past , that is something much to be desired .
just ask nigel lawson .

july 's sioux city crash has fueled an emotionally charged debate .
but the federal aviation administration is reluctant to require separate seats for babies because of the added cost for traveling parents .
some faa officials note that few infants have been killed in plane crashes , raising the question of whether safety seats really are needed .
all 50 states require that small children be strapped into safety seats in cars .
on planes , faa rules dictate that children two years old and over have their own tickets and be strapped into regular seats , just as adults are .
babies under two may sit on laps and fly for free .
but it is almost impossible to keep hold of a baby during an air crash , or even in severe turbulence .
during the sioux city crash , lori michaelson of cincinnati lost her grip on her baby as the plane lurched and tipped over .
another passenger heard one - year - old sabrina 's cry and pulled her from an overhead luggage compartment .
the people acted like i was transporting heroin , '' she says .
one reservation agent told her - - incorrectly - - that the airline barred the use of the seats on flights .
after the sioux city crash , lori michaelson bought a car seat for her daughter for the flight home to cincinnati .
airlines say that such mistakes are decreasing in the aftermath of sioux city , but proponents of the safety devices say they still get complaints from parents . ''
the association of flight attendants , the main flight attendants ` union , is strongly backing that request .
the faa argues that requiring safety seats for all babies might actually diminish , not enhance , safety .
as part of such a rule , officials say , parents would probably be required to buy an extra ticket for the baby .
the increased cost of flying would inevitably encourage some families to drive rather than fly , they say .
commercial airlines have the lowest accident rate of all transportation modes - - much lower than cars , for example .
but he admits that the agency is in '' a very uncomfortable position . ''
he says the agency soon will propose that airlines be prohibited from denying the use of safety seats .
-lrb- most airlines don ' t prohibit their use . -rrb-
he says the agency also will seek public comment on whether the seats should be required .
but privately some airline officials fear that if parents must buy extra tickets for babies , whole families will stop flying .
others worry that the faa might write a rule forcing airlines to pick up part of the tab for increased infant safety .
-lrb- most car seats made in recent years are certified for use on aircraft and are so marked . -rrb-
but space can only be guaranteed if a ticket is purchased .
what the industry really wants is some kind of device that would protect babies without taking up an extra seat .
parents are advised against holding the infants , for fear that in an accident the babies could be crushed by the adult 's weight .
proponents of safety seats are turning up the heat on the faa .
if the faa refuses , rep. lightfoot says , he will push legislation to require the change .
