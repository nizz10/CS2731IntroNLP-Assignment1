yeah , exactly , yeah .
yeah , the , the one thing i think that 's no good for anyone is these monster institutions .
these institutions of th - , thirty thousand students and such .
and that worked out pretty well .
i went from a , you know , a second rate institution to a higher rate institution .
but the first couple of years it does n't matter to me what the quality of the education was .
i needed to make friends .
i needed to sort of learn the ropes .
well , your education 's a lot what you make of it , too , so , - yeah , yeah , exactly .
and if you 're alienated , - i mean i see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having psychological problems , yeah .
that , you think this is n't sinking in .
well , i , i 've seen more graduates from m i t and that , - uh-huh .
yeah , it 's sort of a , a rare select environment .
yeah , and they have their own quirks and tolerances and , <laughter> .
you know , certain things that do n't bother us at all , yeah .
but , these m i t grads are off in their absolute own world .
but , uh , i do n't know .
well , i , i had known a lot of undergraduates who pick schools because they want the best reputation for a school .
not realizing that the reputation for m i t is because of the , of the doctorate research , right .
and the professors who go there , and you 're not going to see the professors -- nope .
-- <laughter> you know , you 're going to see some t a , you know .
reputation for , for research and that 's a one standard , but it 's not relevant , no .
to what they need .
instruct - , professors from other , uh-huh , uh-huh .
for me any time i needed extra help any time of the day -- uh-huh .
-- i had all my instructors home phone numbers -- uh-huh .
-- and could call them , you go to their office anytime .
i had some instructors that , uh , would invite me over to their house for extended study things on weekends , huh .
when i was having trouble with something and , - yeah , you wo n't get that at m i t or virtually or anything like that .
no , no , and that , - and you c - , you know , and you ca n't blame the professors either , no .
so i 'd say go to a , go to a college that has teachers .
people who really are committed to the students and can afford to be because that 's their job .
but , oh , well <laughter> .
- yeah , it 's , there 's a lot of factors that people do n't ever , ever consider -- uh-huh .
i , i 'd hate it , you know .
yeah , so do you have a , do you have a garden , or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn ?
well , it 's , yeah , it 's , it 's primarily just , uh , like landscaping a little bit .
uh , she ends up with so many plants that she ca n't fit them all in her garden .
they have a huge yard and a huge house , and so she brings them up here from philadelphia and gives me all her extras .
well , that 's pretty good .
my , my sister is very over zealous , too .
she 's got some really nice flower beds .
she puts a lot of time into them .
this is my first year in a , in a house where i 'm thinking about doing some flower beds and stuff .
oh , we , i 've always had crude ones at my father 's , but -- yeah .
-- this is the first time that i really have to landscape a house .
his house is more like a farm house .
it 's not on a main road .
my house is on a main road , and it has nothing <laughter> .
i mean , nothing .
i think we figured out total , this is for vegetables -- uh-huh .
-- about two thirds of an acre .
so we each have a third of an acre we do .
jeez , that 's -- that 's a lot <laughter> .
-- so , um , it just happens they built a shopping center next to it -- oh , jeez .
uh , i enjoy it , um , the gardens are kind of old , you have to step down in them now -- uh-huh .
-- because we 've tilled them so much , but there 's still , - we , we , my sister uses probably a fertilizer .
i do n't know if that 's a good thing or a bad thing .
but i wish this phone would stop screeching , are you getting a lot of static on your end of the line ?
i 'm trying , - i do n't know if it 's my phone .
it 's not getting any better .
yeah , i ca n't even hear what you 're <static> , - oh , okay .
oh jeez , it 's gone .
yeah , i guess i was having a hard time there too .
i thought it sounded , - well , i guess we better stick to the subject -- yeah .
-- for the benefit of the people uh , uh , doing this work .
yeah , we grow a lot of , uh , the basic , corn , potatoes .
she likes to really get into her pumpkins and see how many she can grow .
bas - , corn , potatoes , and , uh , acorn squash are good winter keepers .
i mean , things the way we grow are carrots , cabbage , that sort of goes to waste -- uh-huh .
-- you know , we eat it , we , - just too much .
she , she starts her own plants .
she plants a lot of tomatoes -- uh-huh .
but she does , she helps me a lot , too .
she puts a lot of financial .
she plans it all out .
beans like to be near certain types of plants .
now , they find that tomatoes do n't do well if you put them next to something like , uh , peas , i do n't know .
i guess it 's , it 's just what scents it gives off , they just do n't like each other .
i mean , she , she reads all kinds of books , so .
i wish i knew more to tell you why , but , - huh .
my mom put , uh , cantaloupes and cucumbers near each other once , and the got cross pollinated by the bees -- yeah <laughter> .
oh , that 's really weird .
yeah , i mean , there , these were like some mutant .
i 've put my cucumbers down at one end of the garden and like i 'll make an l shape i 've put my cantaloupe .
so they 've been pretty close together .
but i do n't think the vines .
um , either that or my mom just had some bad seed or something .
this year , this last season it was too wet up here -- uh-huh .
-- we lost a lot of our root things , our squash and our potatoes , and we got half our yield .
- it was really bad because of the water .
-- yeah , seven yards of sand .
i got to shovel it all , lots of fun .
and i 'm going to , - my problem is i want to use those rail ties to build up a planter -- sure .
-- in there -- well , it seems , - -- i mean , i guess it 'd go with my flowers .
-- but i do n't think i could really eat the fruit off it without wondering .
and i do n't know if they make landscape ties that are n't treated .
well , you can get , um , you can get pressurized lumber , yeah , but they put , oh , that 's right .
some kind of chemicals in there too .
there 's even , there 's bad chemicals in those too .
but , i , - yeah , i do want to have a raised bed .
i 've never , - my flower gardens are always been like on the ground .
they do n't , it just looks so much better when it 's up against the house , tiered up .
well , you can see it a little better and it stands out .
yeah , this house that i have is just a three bedroom ranch and i can tell you there 's nothing around it , cement -- um .
-- foundation all the way around it .
not a shrub , not a bush .
-- and i 'm looking at him like , jeez .
<laughter> people would kill to have a lilac bush -- yeah .
-- and he 's cutting it down <laughter> .
that 's all right .
flower beds are all right .
anything , as long as it does n't rub up against the siding .
- rub up against the siding .
uh , yeah , that 's what he 's worried about .
the trees , or a bush , because lilac bushes , they , they grow fast .
so , they 're kind of a pain , but , you know , people who do n't have them think they 're great .
and people who do have them , <laughter> .
another thing i have that , um , is weird is the , a locus tree in the back yard .
as a matter of fact there 's three of them , very badly trimmed , they are n't trimmed at all .
yeah , they 're like , - i think i 've seen those before , but i do n't remember what they look like .
they 're a pretty tree , but you just , when you walk up to them they 're covered with thorns .
-- rip your skin .
it 's worse than a rose bush .
many times worse , because of course , it 's a tree .
oh , a tree is always something very nice to have .
yeah , my dad used to work on them , so i do n't think i 'll have a problem .
my husband will have problems borrowing one .
well , if that 's not the problem ... - okay , have you ever served as a juror ?
i 've never been served on the jury , never been called up in a jury , although some of my friends have been jurors .
i never have either .
you have n't , huh .
if you were , uh , what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers ?
well , i think it 's a good idea .
i think our justice system needs a major overhaul , and i 'm not sure what needs to be done to fix it .
but i think they 've got a lot of problems .
i think the major thing they need to correct is how long it takes something to get to jury , and to get to trial .
and i do n't know if that 's just a pure volumes number or , or what , but , uh .
sometimes i think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined , and they 're too easily swayed by their emotion .
yeah , i think that 's true .
hence is possible error as you can see in all the ironsides , <laughter> t v shows .
do , would you prefer all trials by a judge ?
yeah , i would agree with that .
-- you know , the death penalty and such .
if they give them all the information .
-- the judge decides whether or not they should hear it .
-- although you still hear about those occasionally .
do you think the verdict should be completely unanimous by the jury ?
um , i do n't know .
-- and they went by each one , saying guilty or innocent , guilty or innocent .
and they took it more as just like a majority .
so i , i , - some of them disagree , i mean , some of them said one way and some the other .
exactly , but they took , you know , whatever the majority was .
so i did n't know if that was just something for drama or that 's truly the way it is .
i always thought it had to be unanimous .
i think it does have to be unanimous .
and , - i did , i did also .
yeah , i thi - , i do n't know how i feel about that .
i think maybe , uh , majority might be sufficient .
it 's hard to say though .
what about in international trials .
do you think they should have a jury there ?
i think that would be kind of interesting .
yeah , i had n't thought about international trials at all .
i guess the , the problem with that is there 's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts -- right .
-- like , you know , the old day with the rack .
we , they 're going to say , okay , you 're guilty and you have to pay kuwait four million dollars .
well , whose going to really make them .
yeah , i think maybe they 'd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average joe off the street -- uh-huh .
-- for something like that because of the cultural differences .
i do n't know how , what it would take to be , come up with a true perfect system , or if one exists .
but , - yeah .
what about uniform sentencing ?
uh , is that the crime and it 's already , some chart and determine the punishment , or .
yeah , like if you 're convicted of a certain crime you automatically get so many years .
it 's not a discretionary thing .
i think there should be a core minimum that they get -- uh-huh .
but , - yeah .
i wish that when they sentence someone , if they 're going to sentence him to five years , then make him serve five years .
yeah , i , - and i guess you 're eligible after twenty-seven for parole , even though you 're in for life .
yeah , and sometimes those people are , are young enough , they can still get out and cause a lot of trouble .
yeah , i do n't believe that very often happens .
because uh , inside the jail there , i do n't think there 's no real rehabilitation .
i do n't think so either .
in fact , i think they end up worse , because the conditions are so bad .
yeah , it 's another war zone .
but , who knows .
cleaning up , or picking up dirt , or weeds , or who knows what .
something besides license plates and tiddlywinks .
trading their lives for cigarettes -- yeah .
-- those kinds of things .
well , i think that covers it .
nice talking to you .
nice talking to you also .
have a wonderful easter .
so , uh , do you think russia 's still a threat ?
well , i guess i 'm maybe naive , but i never did feel that russia was a big threat to us .
there you go <tv> .
well , i think , - h - , have you ever read the book nineteen eighty-four ?
okay , you know , like , how , uh , these two , there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other -- uh-huh .
-- right , and you could picture it as being russia versus the u s -- right .
and you did n't want that to happen .
and to me , it had always been that way .
i mean what happens is , you have a government , right , and this government controls everything , right -- yeah .
-- and then you have the people inhabiting the country and these people have nothing to do with the government itself .
and these people are the same as you are .
like i was telling people , i 'm really mad because the whole thing in the middle east this was going on .
in lith - , in lithuania , they , they were announced to be a separate country .
it 's like you 're not going to go in there and say no , listen , there 's a separate country .
why , because you 're going into the border .
once you get into the border , then there 's a threat .
-lcb- c but what happens is you do n't mess with us , we wo n't mess with you , but let 's mess with the neutral countries .
and the u s has .
but not the u s s r , right .
the u s s r -- uh-huh .
-- would n't do it .
because they got too much at stake .
i mean -- well , -- why not .
i mean the first , you can imagine the first , uh , chemical weapon used -- uh-huh .
-- that would have meant a total attack of the iraq country within , you know , three hours of when the weapon was shot .
oh , so you think it was fear that kept iraq from -- right .
i mean , if he were to use that , he might as well commit suicide -- uh-huh .
-- because he 's going to be captured and , you know .
we 'll overthrow you , but yet you can still come live here , you know .
right , i do n't think we 've done that to saddam hussein yet .
uh <laughter> , no .
i think that 's , that 's , that 's not very likely .
but yet you know , as , as the parallel russia is that saddam hussein is using the chemical warfare -- yeah .
-- on his own people .
and i guess that makes sense what you said that , uh , within their own borders they feel freer to do -- right .
-- what , what they feel necessary .
that 's my thing .
i do n't believe that anybody should die -- uh-huh .
but that same person also has a family and , you know -- right .
-- his parents are going to cry and , you know , life ends there and to me that 's ridiculous .
you know , i mean , i just do n't believe it .
well -- you know .
-- or that , that it resolves anything in the end .
that -- + yeah .
-- that negotiations could n't resolve .
a lot of like dancers and stuff like that .
they said that they would n't leave russia unless russia told them that they could n't travel anymore and compete .
so it must be a beautiful country .
so , oh , well , i got to go to class now .
okay , well thanks .
nice talking to you .
so , what do you think about a year or two of public service ?
-- but people that i have known that have done that , like from other countries , especially , yeah .
-- because of it , they 're much more responsible .
i really agree with you .
-- and i think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because i come from nice middle class white suburban home -- uh-huh .
-- and i , it changed , it probably changed my political views it changed my understanding of the world around me -- uh-huh .
<< clinking and rattling in background .
<< background voices >> that does that ?
because one of my neighbors , uh , did that in pittsburgh , from pittsburgh .
i think it would have been a very good , um , experience for me .
well , i think so , it puts you out on your own and -- uh-huh .
and things like that and i think that it would help people to become , yes .
less self-centered , uh-huh .
and to be more responsible when you 're out on your own trying to , um , uh-huh .
thinking less of your own needs but , yeah .
-- and i worked in a very rural school district and i , i , one of the things i taught was a computer class -- uh-huh .
-- and these kids , um , you know , - every girl i taught , except for one , was pregnant .
many of the boys in the room had children and they were , they were high school juniors .
i think it 's a really good idea .
and even if it is overseas .
-- are , they do military service which , you know , uh-huh .
i do n't exactly recommend <noise> , yeah .
but still they have benefited from it .
and , um , you know , although i would n't want it to make people to go off to the military voluntarily - but -- uh-huh .
-- it 's , it has helped them and they are just a lot more mature , uh-huh .
than the average student and << sounds like she 's washing dishes >> , - yeah .
i think it would also help them if they then went on to college .
i know that my first couple of years of college were , um , uh , probably too carefree at the , uh-huh .
beginning and then at the end i had to be too serious . .
well , that 's right .
a lot of people they flunk out or they get , + uh-huh .
they just get so excited to be away from home , uh-huh .
they just spend all there time partying and -- yeah , that 's true .
i , yeah , i think , i think this was , this was a very interesting topic -- yeah .
-- uh , because it 's something that , you know , we do n't talk about in this country probably enough .
uh , you know , - be - , because we 're so , we love our freedom -- uh-huh .
-- and our freedom of choice -- yeah , that 's true .
-- and , um , having people << rattling like ice >> .
- but , you know , our , - like in our church , it , it is , your free to do that or not -- uh-huh .
oh , i think it is .
-- and , um , i find great disgust in them , in their , in their , um , <laughter> their -rsb- self-centeredness -- uh-huh .
-- and their inability to understand , um , multicultural or multiracial situation -- uh-huh .
yeah , i think that 's , uh , just having a good time .
and <clicking> , - i , uh , - a friend of mine is a psychologist and he always refers to it as short-term pleasure oriented .
i guess he 's a technical aspect he likes to apply to it , uh-huh .
you know , today 's young people are short-term pleasure oriented , that 's true .
<< rattling paper noise .
>> and everything has to be an immediate reward and it has to be fun .
that 's really true .
because i guess because of the changes in eastern europe , uh , they 've increased funding for the peace corps .
some of the , i guess it 's some of the peace dividend in the sense , you known , - uh-huh .
when they 're decreasing some of the military spending , huh .
some of that money has gone into the peace corps and some of the are the overseas programs .
uh , well , i have seen a big change , i think , in high school kids that my relatives << rattling paper >> , uh-huh .
because they make a lot of money .
yeah , that 's true .
and they do n't have a goal , they do n't have a goal , they do n't have an interest in their own field of study .
they 're just looking what 's going to pay the biggest cash .
yeah , that 's very true .
in the washington , area .
area , are lawyers , yes .
and , and i just sort of think that 's ridiculous .
yeah , with -- there 's just too many people .
-- and , and tha - , how come everybody is a lawyer , you know , you know <laughter> , that 's right .
not enough people want to do that to , + uh-huh .
for , uh , because of a service that they could provide .
you know , if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need -- uh-huh .
- statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most money in the long run .
yeah , that 's true .
that 's kind of sad .
- that 's interesting .
well , i guess i better go .
hey , thanks so much for the conversation .
well , good luck to you .
well , thank you very much .
if you want to go first , go ahead .
oh , i think , i think that a woman 's role has come a long way .
with the pay and everything , you know .
i feel that , uh , we 've missed as far as the top jobs go .
you know , the higher echelon .
there may be a few , but very incidental .
<laughter> and i really think that it will be a long time , probably , before we see that .
you know , that they are not in the home by choice anymore .
it 's mostly , you know , - even if you want to say home , you really ca n't .
<laughter> and a lot of times you ca n't , yeah .
she never really had a chance to work .
she worked before she got married , but , uh , she , uh , she does n't believe in , - she 's very old fashioned .
she does n't believe in the woman working unless she has to .
that 's what i mean , and -- yeah .
-- you know , there 's a lot of truth to that .
if you are not going to have a family , then that 's fine , then , you know , a career is a smart choice .
and i think it 's great , but if you , you have a family , i think you owe the family a responsibility .
-- i , i think that the mother and the child lose , and i think that 's why there is so many problems -- yeah .
-- you know , with kids today , because they do n't have the family roots anymore .
you know , i 'm not saying that , that it 's totally gone , but it 's nothing like what it used to be .
you know , in that sense .
and the house and that kind of thing .
that 's very true , but then they should n't have a family .
that 's what i 'm saying , you know , i think it 's great that women have a choice today .
that there are ways to prevent families , you know , like basically there 's contraceptives and -- yeah .
-- all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies .
there is no need to have children if you do n't want them .
that 's fine , that 's , that 's the freedom of choice .
and i agree with that , because anyone who has children that does n't really want them is n't going to be a good parent .
well , i should n't say they are not going to be a good parent .
they wo n't be a caring parent .
like they wo n't have that , - or they wo n't be as good as they could be .
right , that 's what i mean , they 'll feel like it 's a job .
it 's not like something that they really wanted .
like i had three children , and i mean i , i wanted every one of them .
you know , i had to work , but i tried to make it as painless as possible .
it was like i did n't belong anymore .
and it was because i had worked for about nine months , and when they were coming home i was going to work .
so we were , i felt i was losing my family .
and i worked that shift for eleven years .
<laughter> bless you <laughter> .
just so that my kids would have me at home .
you know , and i feel that 's very important , it really is , and it 's too bad because mothers miss out on so much too .
so i mean in the sense that we 've come a long way , yes , but we 've sacrificed a lot to get there .
yeah , i , i agree .
but then it got to be a point where they got some independence .
and they just enjoyed the income , the extra .
a man can afford the necessities , a woman affords the luxuries .
and i notice today kids , you know , - like we had apartments before we had homes .
and we had to walk before we had a car .
and now kids at sixteen years old , they have their birthday , what do they get , they get a car .
oh , i know <laughter> .
and to me , it 's like we 've lost our values in this country .
you will take better care of that , and you will prize that possession .
more than someone handing something to you .
see , yeah , see , now , my parents , there is no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college .
-- a lot more common sense -- yeah .
-- than these kids that do n't have that responsibility .
sure , they probably do n't even have any .
well , if they do , they do n't know it , you know <laughter> .
and no one can tell anyone anything -- oh , i know .
you know , there is no harm in that , whereas sometimes you ca n't even get that from a kid , you know .
<laughter> just attention , you know .
-- president someday , maybe <laughter> .
i think it will be freedom of choice .
well , i still think people have a choice .
you know , if you can live with it , and it 's , you know , your conscience is clear -- uh-huh .
-- then i mean all of us are going to answer to it one day , maybe .
i do n't know .
i mean no one has said for sure , you know .
but , - i think if a woman would get into politics or enough women get into politics , i think it will definitely be freedom of choice .
which i mean i think it should be anyway .
i , i do .
because i mean you as an individual , what you do , that to me is your business .
and , uh , - and different circumstances call for different things .
exactly , exactly , that 's ... - okay .
and spring break with the kids i , um , i had n't been thinking much about the middle east and what 's going on over there .
have you been keeping up ?
i guess , you know , the thing really is n't over .
unless they 're just absolutely forced to .
so , i guess , from what i understand the thing could just -- + start up .
there 's no official document signed or anything ?
not yet at all .
and it was really , - what i felt was kind of cynical because it there just has n't been any peace over there ever <laughter> .
in thousands of years , yeah .
i do n't know , of history .
why they expect it 's going to start this week , you know .
and they fight with each other and they have such hatred for , uh , israel and , - yeah .
the , uh , the thing that 's kind of interesting about this , - my sons in the air force .
so he ended up going to korea and his buddies ended up going to saudi .
well , he 's still in korea and his buddies home now <laughter> .
he , he almost wishes that , that he could have gone home .
and got it over with .
well , i just , there 's just no way for us to be involved over there and hope that there will be much peace .
and , um , with , - and that i 'm afraid that we would have to stay .
-- and the british and the french -- uh-huh .
so , the country of , + <children> .
of kuwait really does n't make just a whole lot of sense except that it is an excepted place , you know -- yeah .
-- it 's like any other country , you know , for whatever reason it 's , it 's actually there .
and it 's just that this was an excuse , you know , to make some noise <noise> .
now , now we are a , uh , a legitimate player , <whispering> .
so -- right <tv> .
-- that kind of ups our stock in there just a little bit .
it makes us more legitimate .
-- and caused problems .
well , i just , uh , i 'm not interested in keeping big military over there and having to go and call the shots like you say .
and i just would prefer that , - i mean sometimes we 've said let 's keep , we 're not interested in what other countries do .
i do n't , <laughter> .
i hope we do n't try to keep , uh , in there and try to keep our fingers in the pot and try to , um .
stay over there because we just do n't want to send our people there and make them stay .
we , + yeah .
we got this , - we 're , we 're used to wars where you can get in do the job and get out .
vietnam we never did get out , you know , never did get the job done because they were too ham strung .
you know , yeah .
got in and got out .
which is , seems to be exactly what 's happening right at the moment .
there , there never will be .
so that 's , that 's a little rough , you know , we 're not , we 're not quite up to that sort of thing .
- well , i guess i better go i have a repairman just came , oh <laughter> .
for my refrigerator , oh , well , that 's , + but , - that 's fun .
well , i enjoyed the topic .
i hope you have a good day .
uh , okay , go ahead .
, no , no , go ahead .
peru , but , but recently i have been following the middle east rather than , yeah .
central america << very faint >> .
yeah , it does seem to have quieted down there just a little bit that 's , that 's for sure .
we did n't seem to be going in and taking anything out of the country other than just it 's , it 's labor , uh-huh .
yeah , i understand what you say .
and at the time i thought there ought to be a law against american tourists .
uh-huh , uh-huh << very faint >> .
uh-huh << very faint >> .
well , you were in peru ?
this was when the peace corps first are started , uh-huh .
and you could n't just , take up , take off and leave your group and go explore and , and things like that , uh-huh .
uh-huh << very faint >> .
what , uh , what area did you live in ?
i was up in arequipa .
oh , okay yeah .
and , um << very faint >> , - i 've heard of it .
uh-huh << very faint >> so .
- well , is , are they , is peace corps still active down in there ?
and the same with the co-ops .
well , that 's , that was kind of the , the aim was n't it , to get it started and then have it , right .
i did teach economics at the university one night a week , and the textbook was in english , but basically i taught it in spanish , oh .
because , i mean , i really did n't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test .
we just bought a new house .
well , yeah , and to some extent , utilities , i imagine .
they have that to some extent here , but it 's not quite as good .
and , uh , transportation expenses , i guess you own a car .
and you know how much you 're going to drive every week ?
so , so , it was , you know , two miles a day <laughter> to and from work .
so it kind of cut my transportation costs a lot .
yeah , i understand that .
we , we have a real similar situation .
ours , uh , have quintupled , at least .
so there is a real family budget .
yeah , pretty much , um .
the problem is there never seems to be enough money .
i have three left in the house .
nowadays , thirty-five dollars buys about one pair of shoes -- if you 're lucky .
-- yeah , so i mean things have just really gone out of sight in the last , uh , i guess about the last ten years .
wow , must be nice .
part of the high price spread .
uh , no , well , we do n't , we do , but we do n't have a family budget .
we have the fixed things we have to pay .
and we have the things that are extras .
but it seems that by and large the extras just do n't exist .
and , well , you know , the auto budget , car payment sucks a hell of a lot of it dry .
and insurance , is insurance bad there ?
um , i 've got , uh , two older cars .
there both , - one 's a seventy-seven and one 's a seventy-eight .
well , we 've got one eighty-nine .
and my insurance is about , it was running about four hundred dollars a year .
that 's not bad , four hundred and something a year .
that 's , that 's , - it 's actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars .
that 's cheaper than we pay .
yeah , i was down in texas for two years , and i was paying unbelievable rates for both car insurance and for home insurance .
um , well , here in colorado it 's even worse because we have no fault .
